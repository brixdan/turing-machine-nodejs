##### Every deterministic infinite process produces fractal
- Fractal is a structure that repeats low scale pattern on larger scales, because initial information is limited, no source of creativity exists to produce something new on big time spans
- Deterministic process that didn't halt on a scale of a few hundred times larger than seed number ends up to cycle/oscillate/loop which is easy to identify in any particular case and to prove mathematically, that the proccess repeats itself and will never halt in future
- Every state of TM potentially designates a double ternary operator. So TM with a couple of dozens of states represents an algorithm of complexity, superior to real life. Not every big project has that number of ternaries. Low on memory but high on logic. Memory comes from tape.
- Interesting: already on size = 30 champion almost exeeds the allowed depth:
            champ =  {
              steps: 2035,
              tape: 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,
                1, 1, 0, 1, 0,
                0, 1

            }
depth = 200 * length/12 = 2400 - quite same numbers
- with very little possibility to get mistaked,
we have a group of 28 first numbers that diverge of each other:
